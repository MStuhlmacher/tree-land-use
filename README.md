# Bridging the land use gap: Examining tree canopy cover and connectivity by land use in 10 U.S. cities
This research assess the distribution of tree canopy cover by land use (single-family, multi-family, parks, and industrial) in 10 U.S. cities. The cities are tested: Chicago, IL; Houston, TX; Indianapolis, IN; Jacksonville, FL; Los Angeles, CA; New York, NY; Phoenix, AZ; Portland, OR; Seattle, WA; and Saint Louis; MO.
